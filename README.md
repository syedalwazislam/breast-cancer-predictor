# Breast Cancer Classification Model

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is a **Breast Cancer Classification Model** that predicts whether a tumor is malignant or benign based on medical diagnostic features. It is built using a **Random Forest algorithm with hyperparameter tuning** to achieve high accuracy. The model is deployed as a **web application using Streamlit**.

## 🚀 Features
- Predicts **malignant or benign** tumors based on input features.
- Uses a **Random Forest algorithm** for classification.
- Implements **hyperparameter tuning** for better performance.
- Displays accuracy metrics and a **classification report**.
- User-friendly **web interface using Streamlit**.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- **Machine Learning** (Random Forest Classifier)
- **Streamlit** (Web App Deployment)
- **Git & GitHub** (Version Control)

## 📂 Installation & Setup
Follow these steps to set up and run the project locally:

```sh
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-URL>
cd breast-cancer-classification

# Create a virtual environment (optional)
python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate  # On macOS/Linux
env\Scripts\activate     # On Windows

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the Streamlit app
streamlit run app.py
```

## 📊 Usage
1. Upload a CSV file containing patient diagnostic data.
2. View the data insights and visualizations.
3. Enter patient feature values to classify the tumor.
4. Analyze model accuracy and classification metrics.

## 🏗️ Future Enhancements
- Implement more advanced models (Neural Networks, SVM, etc.).
- Add real-time integration with medical imaging datasets.
- Improve UI/UX for better user experience.
- Enable API integration for hospital databases.
